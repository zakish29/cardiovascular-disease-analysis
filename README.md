## Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a group of conditions that affect the heart and blood vessels. It is one of the leading causes of death worldwide and a significant burden on global health systems. CVD includes coronary artery disease, heart failure, stroke, and other conditions that damage the heart and blood vessels. Risk factors for CVD include high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, smoking, obesity, and physical inactivity. Due to changes in lifestyle and diet, CVD has become a critical issue to tackle in the modern world. Preventing and managing CVD requires early detection and intervention, making accurate prediction of CVD outcomes a crucial area of research.

## Objective:
To correctly predict as many positive cases (patients with heart disease) as possible with the following goals:

 - The model will predict death due to heart disease using the given data.
 - To find the best `recall`
 - We implement Random Forest Classifier in machine learning algorithms to train and test the model on the given dataset.
 - Predicting death due to heart disease is relevant to improving patient outcomes and reducing the burden of CVD on global health systems.
 - The model will be developed and evaluated within a fixed timeframe.


Hence, we aim to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify patients at high risk of dying due to heart disease. This will enable early intervention and improve patient outcomes.
